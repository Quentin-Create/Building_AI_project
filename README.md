# Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
***Paced Education – Learning at each’s right rhythm***

## Background
The current global education pattern consists in ‘yearly packages’, where everyone is supposed to learn the same quantity of material, with some options.
However, it is clear that not everyone learns each subject at the same pace. Some rush through any subject (science, history, maths ...), some struggle on every subject, but more than often one will be more at ease with a series of classes and have hard time with the others.
The problem is, given the course is dispensed at the same pace for everyone, that some will just drop-off and fail their grade, and some will get bored, not pay attention while they could have learned one level further.
The idea is to use actual techniques to dispense education at differentiated paces. Let’s take a couple of examples:
* **Maths**: if you solve the exercises quicker than average, you get access to the next series. On the opposite, if you fail in following the pace, you get further explanations and additional (simpler) exercises, breaking down the difficulty in smaller bits.
* **History**: if you get the ‘story’, you get more detailed information, additional facts, more context. If not, you get the material in more absorbable form, e.g. a cartoon, snackable and/or fun facts, anything that helps you getting into the topic.

## Data and AI techniques:
The main data is obviously the entire graduation course contents, that needs to be structured in levels in sublevels as to track the students progress (this might also raise the question of what a student is expected to know when he graduates).
The other crucial dataset is the individual and collective progress. The collective progress is important as to get an overall benchmark an understand who moves faster or slower. The individual progress is obviously the indicator for how the course should be adapted.
AI can be used for:
* Structuring the course contents and defining the (sub)levels, with automated learning as to improve them given the tracked student experience
* Tracking the collective and individual progress
* Adapting the content ‘in real time’ for the parts that show up as problematic (for example, there is no need to create simplified explanations for the entire world history, but it would come in useful for a specific part, for a specific student).
## How is it used
Based on regular (weekly?) evaluations, each students program is adapted with new objectives for the upcoming week.
Teachers will see their roles adapted, as linear classes would no longer be relevant. They could see new tasks popping up, such as verifying the AI generated adapted content, monitoring the students learning curves (eg. different approach for someone that skyrockets the exercises and someone that is below the educational baseline), with more of a coaching approach.

## Challenges: 
The challenges are numerous, as this would involve among others the fundamental review of the educational system, safeguards for AI generated contents, acceptance from the teaching workforce and from parents.

## What next:
The project could start with a pilot, e.g. an optional course in a few classes and progressively be scoped, first with less strategic subjects and eventually get to the full mix.
